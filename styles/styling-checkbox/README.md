# Styling a Checkbox
---

Example 1 is pretty useless.

Example 2 is nice

Example 3 is from GPT, also nice, but you can't press on the checkbox box itself.

Example 4 is some crappy thing that I did

Example 5 is from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyLzwR-iXtI) and it's really good

Example 6 is a small modification of Example 5 which allows you to respond differently to click on the text rather than checking the checkbox
