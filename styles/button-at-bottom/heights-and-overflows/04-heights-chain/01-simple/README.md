# Heights chain - simple
---

We have a `html` and `body` with height set to 100% to take all the viewport.

Inside we have main that takes 95% width, no fixed height.

Inside main we have the `.sections` container, which is 95% width.
The contents inside are taller than the viewport.

The _scroll box_ is the window itself. 

This  is a starter, let's see the next phase.
