# Button at bottom - simple
---

The `html` is 100% height of the viewport.
The `body` is 95% height and width of `html` for clarity
`main` is again 95% of `body`
`.sections` is inside main, along with `button`
`button` is absolutely positioned, and the positioning context is `main`
`.sections` MUTS have a `height` set so that the scrolling will be on it.
