# align-items
---

This example shows how to use the `align-items` property.

In this example, we have 4 grid areas. We set `align-items: start` on the grid container. 
This aligns the content within the grid areas to be aligned to the start of the tracks in the block axis.

The default value of `align-items` is `normal`, which resolves to `stretch` in grids.

The height of each div will be determined by the content of the div. If you omit the `align-items`, the divs will stretch to fill the grid areas.
