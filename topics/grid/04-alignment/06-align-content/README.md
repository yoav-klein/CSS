# Aligning the grid tracks on the block axis
---

using `align-content` and `justify-self` you can align the grid tracks themselves, unlike `align-items` and `justify-items` which aligns the items within the grid areas.

In the `01-deafult.html` example we set a fixed height/width for the container, and a fixed height/width for the tracks. By default, the tracks will be aligned to the top-left corner of the container.

Playing with `align-content` changes this.
