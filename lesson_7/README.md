# Styling Links
---

Links (using the `<a href>` element) have default styles: They are blue, underlined, after visited they turn purple, and the cursor turns
to pointer when you hover them.

You can set the styles for links using the `a` selector, and with pseudo-classes you can set the styles of links
when they are hovered, visited, etc.

Introduced:
* `a` selector
* `a:visited` pseudo-class
* `a:hover` pseudo-class
* `a:visited` pseudo-class
* `a:active` pseudo-class
* `a:focus` pseudo-class
