# Box Model
---

Each element can be thought of as a box, which have the following components: content, padding, border, and margin.
Inside we have the content. Surrounding it we have the padding. Surrounding it we have the border, and the margin
sets the distance of the element from its enclosing element.

Introduced:
* box-sizing: configures the target of the `height` and `width` properties, whether it'll refer to the content or to the border.
* CSS reset: instead of letting the browser define defaul values for margins and paddings, do a CSS reset using the `* { }` and 
set default values
* padding
* outline
* margin
