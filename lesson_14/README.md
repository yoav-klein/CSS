# Flexbox
---

You can set `display: flex` on a container, and it will change how the items in this container (the flex items)
are arranged.

Introduced:
* `justify-content` - how the items are justified - center, right, left, etc.
* `gap` - the gap between the items
* `align-items` - how to align the items on the Y-axis if the flex-direction is row, or on the X-axis if the flex-direction is column.
* `flex-direction` - whether the items are arranged in a row or in a column.
* `flex-wrap` - whether the items wrap when the window gets smaller.
* `align-content` - how rows relate to each other.
* `flex-basis` - the base size of the flex item. This is set on an element as a flex item, not a flex container
* `flex-grow` - how much the flex item will grow when the window is resized to be bigger
* `flex-shrink` - how much the flex item will shrink when the window is resized to be smaller
