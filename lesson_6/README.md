# Typography
---

Typography is how text is displayed.

Introduced:
* text-decoration: overline, underline, line-through,
* text-transform: capitalize for example, to capitalize every word.
* text-align - right, left, center, justify.
* text-indent - indent the first line of the paragraph
* line-height - the space between lines.
* letter-spacing - space between letters.
* word-spacing
* font-weight - bold or not.
* font-style - italic
* font-family - this usually you don't set on specific element but on the whole document.
font-family can take a list of values, which are fallbacks in case the browser doesn't have the font installed.
