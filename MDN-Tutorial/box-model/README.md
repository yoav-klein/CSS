# Box model
---

1. regular block boxes - h1, p, div
    * break into a new line
    * takes the whole width by default
    * you can set height and width on it
    * padding, borders and margins push away other elements
2. span is an inline element, so:
    * doesn't break to a new line
    * height and width are not respected
    * padding, borders and margins push only to the sides, not top and bottom
3. Set span as a block-level element
4. standard model vs alternate model
